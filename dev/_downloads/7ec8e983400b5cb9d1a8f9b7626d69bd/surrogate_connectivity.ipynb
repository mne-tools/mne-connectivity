        "## Background\n\nWhen performing connectivity analyses, we often want to know whether the results we\nobserve reflect genuine interactions between signals. We can assess this by performing\nstatistical tests between our connectivity estimates and a 'baseline' level of\nconnectivity. However, due to factors such as background noise and sample\nsize-dependent biases (see e.g. :footcite:`VinckEtAl2010`), it is often not\nappropriate to treat 0 as this baseline. Therefore, we need a way to estimate the\nbaseline level of connectivity.\n\nOne approach is to manipulate the original data in such a way that the covariance\nstructure is destroyed, creating surrogate data. Connectivity estimates from the\noriginal and surrogate data can then be compared to determine whether the original\ndata contains significant interactions.\n\nSuch surrogate data can be easily generated in MNE using the\n:func:`~mne_connectivity.make_surrogate_data` function, which shuffles epoched data\nindependently across channels :footcite:`PellegriniEtAl2023` (see the Notes section of\nthe function for more information). In this example, we will demonstrate how surrogate\ndata can be created, and how you can use this to assess the statistical significance\nof your connectivity estimates.\n\n"
