        "## Background\n\nMultivariate forms of signal analysis allow you to simultaneously consider\nthe activity of multiple signals. In the case of connectivity, the\ninteraction between multiple sensors can be analysed at once, producing a\nsingle connectivity spectrum. This approach brings not only practical\nbenefits (e.g. easier interpretability of results from the dimensionality\nreduction), but can also offer methodological improvements (e.g. enhanced\nsignal-to-noise ratio and reduced bias).\n\nA popular bivariate measure of connectivity is the imaginary part of\ncoherency, which looks at the correlation between two signals in the\nfrequency domain and is immune to spurious connectivity arising from volume\nconduction artefacts :footcite:`NolteEtAl2004`. However, in cases where\ninteractions between multiple signals are of interest, computing connectivity\nbetween all possible combinations of signals leads to a very large number of\nresults which is difficult to interpret. A common approach is to average\nresults across these connections, however this risks reducing the\nsignal-to-noise ratio of results and burying interactions that are present\nbetween only a small number of channels.\n\nAdditionally, this bivariate measure is susceptible to biased estimates of\nconnectivity based on the spatial proximity of sensors\n:footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012` depending on the degree of source mixing in the\nsignals.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, spatial filters derived from eigendecompositions\nallows connectivity to be analysed in a multivariate manner, removing the\nsource mixing-dependent bias and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of\nconnectivity estimates :footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`. This approach goes beyond\nsimply aggregating information across all possible combinations of signals,\nextracting the underlying components of connectivity in a frequency-resolved\nmanner.\n\nThis leads to the following methods: the maximised imaginary part of\ncoherency (MIC); and the multivariate interaction measure (MIM). These\nmethods are similar to the multivariate method based on coherency (CaCoh\n:footcite:`VidaurreEtAl2019`; see :doc:`cacoh` and\n:doc:`compare_coherency_methods`).\n\nWe start by loading some example MEG data and dividing it into\ntwo-second-long epochs.\n\n"

        "## Multivariate interaction measure (MIM)\n\nAlthough it can be useful to analyse the single, largest connectivity\ncomponent with MIC, multiple such components exist and can be examined with\nMIM. MIM can be thought of as an average of all connectivity components\nbetween the seeds and targets, and can be useful for an exploration of all\navailable components. It is unnecessary to use the spatial filters of each\ncomponent explicitly, and instead the desired result can be achieved from\n$E$ alone (Eq. 14 of :footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`):\n\n$\\textrm{MIM}=tr(\\boldsymbol{EE}^T)$,\n\nwhere again the frequency dependence is omitted. Unlike MIC, MIM is\npositive-valued and can be > 1. Without normalisation, MIM can be\nthought of as reflecting the total interaction between the seeds and targets.\nMIM can be normalised to lie in the range $[0, 1]$ by dividing the\nscores by the number of unique channels in the seeds and targets. Normalised\nMIM represents the interaction *per channel*, which can be biased by factors\nsuch as the presence of channels with little to no interaction. In line with\nthe preferences of the method's authors :footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`, since\nnormalisation alters the interpretability of the results, **normalisation is\nnot performed by default**.\n\nHere we see MIM reveal the strongest connectivity component to be around 10\nHz, with the higher frequency 13-18 Hz connectivity no longer being so\nprominent. This suggests that, across all components in the data, there may\nbe more lower frequency connectivity sources than higher frequency sources.\nThus, when combining these different components in MIM, the peak around 10 Hz\nremains, but the 13-18 Hz connectivity is diminished relative to the single,\nlargest connectivity component of MIC.\n\nLooking at the values for normalised MIM, we see it has a maximum of ~0.1.\nThe relatively small connectivity values thus indicate that many of the\nchannels show little to no interaction.\n\n"

        "## Handling high-dimensional data\n\nAn important issue to consider when using these multivariate methods is\noverfitting, which risks biasing connectivity estimates to maximise noise in\nthe data. This risk can be reduced by performing a preliminary dimensionality\nreduction prior to estimating the connectivity with a singular value\ndecomposition (Eqs. 32 & 33 of :footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`). The degree of this\ndimensionality reduction can be specified using the ``rank`` argument, which\nby default will not perform any dimensionality reduction (assuming your data\nis full rank; see below if not). Choosing an expected rank of the data\nrequires *a priori* knowledge about the number of components you expect to\nobserve in the data.\n\nWhen comparing MIC/MIM scores across recordings, **it is highly recommended\nto estimate connectivity from the same number of channels (or equally from\nthe same degree of rank subspace projection)** to avoid biases in\nconnectivity estimates. Bias can be avoided by specifying a consistent rank\nsubspace to project to using the ``rank`` argument, standardising your\nconnectivity estimates regardless of changes in e.g. the number of channels\nacross recordings. Note that this does not refer to the number of seeds and\ntargets *within* a connection being identical, rather to the number of seeds\nand targets *across* connections.\n\nHere, we will project our seed and target data to only the first 25\ncomponents of our rank subspace. Results for MIM show that the general\nspectral pattern of connectivity is retained in the rank subspace-projected\ndata, suggesting that a fair degree of redundant connectivity information is\ncontained in the remaining 50 components of the seed and target data. We also\nassert that the spatial patterns of MIC are returned in the original sensor\nspace despite this rank subspace projection, being reconstructed using the\nproducts of the singular value decomposition (Eqs. 46 & 47 of\n:footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`).\n\n"
