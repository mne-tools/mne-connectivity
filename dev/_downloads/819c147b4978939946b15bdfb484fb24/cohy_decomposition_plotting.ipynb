        "## Background\nMultivariate forms of signal analysis allow you to simultaneously consider the\nactivity of multiple signals. In the case of connectivity, the interaction between\nmultiple sensors can be analysed at once and the strongest components of this\ninteraction captured in a lower-dimensional set of connectivity spectra. This approach\nbrings not only practical benefits (e.g. easier interpretability of results from the\ndimensionality reduction), but can also offer methodological improvements (e.g.\nenhanced signal-to-noise ratio and reduced bias).\n\nCoherency-based methods are popular approaches for analysing connectivity, capturing\ncorrelations between signals in the frequency domain. Various coherency-based\nmultivariate methods exist, including: canonical coherency (CaCoh; multivariate\nmeasure of coherency/coherence) :footcite:`VidaurreEtAl2019`; and maximised imaginary\ncoherency (MIC; multivariate measure of the imaginary part of coherency)\n:footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`.\n\nThese methods are described in detail in the following examples:\n - comparison of coherency-based methods - :doc:`../compare_coherency_methods`\n - CaCoh - :doc:`../cacoh`\n - MIC - :doc:`../mic_mim`\n\nThe CaCoh and MIC methods work by finding spatial filters that decompose the data into\ncomponents of connectivity, and applying them to the data. Connectivity can then be\ncomputed on this transformed data (see :doc:`cohy_decomposition` for more\ninformation).\n\nHowever, in addition to the connectivity scores, useful insights about the data can be\ngained by visualising the topographies of the spatial filters and their corresponding\nspatial patterns. These provide important information about the spatial distributions\nof connectivity information, and represent two complementary aspects:\n\n- The filters represent how the connectivity sources are extracted from the channel\n  data, akin to an inverse model.\n- The patterns represent how the channel data is formed by the connectivity sources,\n  akin to a forward model.\n\nThis distinction is discussed further in Haufe *et al.* (2014)\n:footcite:`HaufeEtAl2014`, but in short: **the patterns should be used to interpret\nthe contribution of distinct brain regions/sensors to a given component of\nconnectivity**. Accordingly, keep in mind that the filters and patterns are not a\nreplacement for source reconstruction, as without this the patterns will still only\ntell you about the spatial contributions of sensors, not underlying brain regions,\nto connectivity.\n\n"
