# Background
# ----------
#
# Multivariate forms of signal analysis allow you to simultaneously consider
# the activity of multiple signals. In the case of connectivity, the
# interaction between multiple sensors can be analysed at once, producing a
# single connectivity spectrum. This approach brings not only practical
# benefits (e.g. easier interpretability of results from the dimensionality
# reduction), but can also offer methodological improvements (e.g. enhanced
# signal-to-noise ratio).
#
# A popular bivariate measure of connectivity is coherency/coherence, which
# looks at the correlation between two signals in the frequency domain.
# However, in cases where interactions between multiple signals are of
# interest, computing connectivity between all possible combinations of signals
# leads to a very large number of results which is difficult to interpret. A
# common approach is to average results across these connections, however this
# risks reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of results and burying interactions
# that are present between only a small number of channels.
#
# Canonical coherency (CaCoh) is a multivariate form of coherency that uses
# eigendecomposition-derived spatial filters to extract the underlying
# components of connectivity in a frequency-resolved manner
# :footcite:`VidaurreEtAl2019`. This approach goes beyond simply aggregating
# information across all possible combinations of signals.
#
# It is similar to multivariate methods based on the imaginary part of
# coherency (MIC & MIM :footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`; see :doc:`mic_mim` and
# :doc:`compare_coherency_methods`).

# Data Simulation
# ---------------
#
# To demonstrate the CaCoh method, we will use some simulated data consisting
# of two sets of interactions between signals in a given frequency range:
#
# - 5 seeds and 3 targets interacting in the 10-12 Hz frequency range.
# - 5 seeds and 3 targets interacting in the 23-25 Hz frequency range.
#
# We can consider the seeds and targets to be signals of different modalities,
# e.g. cortical EEG signals and subcortical LFP signals, cortical EEG signals
# and muscular EMG signals, etc.... We use the
# :func:`~mne_connectivity.make_signals_in_freq_bands` function to simulate
# these signals.

# %%

# Generate simulated data
data_10_12 = make_signals_in_freq_bands(
    n_seeds=5,
    n_targets=3,
    freq_band=(10, 12),  # 10-12 Hz interaction
    rng_seed=42,
)

data_23_25 = make_signals_in_freq_bands(
    n_seeds=5,
    n_targets=3,
    freq_band=(23, 25),  # 23-25 Hz interaction
    rng_seed=44,
)

# Combine data into a single object
data = data_10_12.add_channels([data_23_25])

###############################################################################
# Computing CaCoh
# ---------------
#
# Having simulated the signals, we can create the indices for computing
# connectivity between all seeds and all targets in a single multivariate
# connection (see :doc:`handling_ragged_arrays` for more information), after
# which we compute connectivity.
#
# For CaCoh, a set of spatial filters are found that will maximise the
# estimated connectivity between the seed and target signals. These maximising
# filters correspond to the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalue, derived
# from an eigendecomposition of information from the cross-spectral density
# (Eq. 8 of :footcite:`VidaurreEtAl2019`):
#
# :math:`\textrm{CaCoh}=\Large{\frac{\boldsymbol{a}^T\boldsymbol{D}(\Phi)
# \boldsymbol{b}}{\sqrt{\boldsymbol{a}^T\boldsymbol{a}\boldsymbol{b}^T
# \boldsymbol{b}}}}`
#
# where: :math:`\boldsymbol{D}(\Phi)` is the cross-spectral density between
# seeds and targets transformed for a given phase angle :math:`\Phi`; and
# :math:`\boldsymbol{a}` and :math:`\boldsymbol{b}` are eigenvectors for the
# seeds and targets, such that :math:`\boldsymbol{a}^T\boldsymbol{D}(\Phi)
# \boldsymbol{b}` maximises coherency between the seeds and targets. All
# elements are frequency-dependent, however this is omitted for readability.
#
# CaCoh is complex-valued in the range :math:`[-1, 1]` where the sign reflects
# the phase angle of the interaction (like for coherency). Taking the absolute
# value is akin to taking the coherence, which is the magnitude of the
# interaction regardless of phase angle.

###############################################################################
# Extracting spatial information from CaCoh
# -----------------------------------------
#
# Whilst a lower-dimensional representation of connectivity information is
# useful, we lose information about which channels are involved in the
# connectivity. Thankfully, this information can be recovered by constructing
# spatial patterns of connectivity from the spatial filters
# :footcite:`HaufeEtAl2014`.
#
# The spatial patterns are stored under ``attrs['patterns']`` of the
# connectivity class, with one value per frequency for each channel in the
# seeds and targets. The patterns can be positive- and negative-valued. Sign
# differences of the patterns can be used to visualise the orientation of
# underlying dipole sources, whereas their absolute value reflects the strength
# of a channel's contribution to the connectivity component. The spatial
# patterns are **not** bound between :math:`[-1, 1]`.
#
# Averaging across the patterns in the 10-12 Hz and 23-25 Hz ranges, we can see
# how it is possible to identify which channels are contributing to
# connectivity at different frequencies.

# Handling high-dimensional data
# ------------------------------
#
# An important issue to consider when using these multivariate methods is
# overfitting, which risks biasing connectivity estimates to maximise noise in
# the data. This risk can be reduced by performing a preliminary dimensionality
# reduction prior to estimating the connectivity with a singular value
# decomposition (Eq. 15 of :footcite:`VidaurreEtAl2019`). The degree of this
# dimensionality reduction can be specified using the ``rank`` argument, which
# by default will not perform any dimensionality reduction (assuming your data
# is full rank; see below if not). Choosing an expected rank of the data
# requires *a priori* knowledge about the number of components you expect to
# observe in the data.
#
# When comparing CaCoh scores across recordings, **it is highly recommended
# to estimate connectivity from the same number of channels (or equally from
# the same degree of rank subspace projection)** to avoid biases in
# connectivity estimates. Bias can be avoided by specifying a consistent rank
# subspace to project to using the ``rank`` argument, standardising your
# connectivity estimates regardless of changes in e.g. the number of channels
# across recordings. Note that this does not refer to the number of seeds and
# targets *within* a connection being identical, rather to the number of seeds
# and targets *across* connections.
#
# Here, we project our seed and target data to only the first 2 components of
# our rank subspace. Results show that the general spectral pattern of
# connectivity is retained in the rank subspace-projected data, suggesting that
# a fair degree of redundant connectivity information is contained in the
# excluded components of the seed and target data.
#
# We also assert that the spatial patterns of MIC are returned in the original
# sensor space despite this rank subspace projection, being reconstructed using
# the products of the singular value decomposition (Eqs. 46 & 47 of
# :footcite:`EwaldEtAl2012`).

# See :doc:`mic_mim` for an example of applying the rank subspace
# projection to real data with a large number of channels.
#
# In the case that your data is not full rank and ``rank`` is left as ``None``,
# an automatic rank computation is performed and an appropriate degree of
# dimensionality reduction will be enforced. The rank of the data is determined
# by computing the singular values of the data and finding those within a
# factor of :math:`1e^{-6}` relative to the largest singular value.
#
# Whilst unlikely, there may be scenarios in which this threshold is too
# lenient. In these cases, you should inspect the singular values of your data
# to identify an appropriate degree of dimensionality reduction to perform,
# which you can then specify manually using the ``rank`` argument. The code
# below shows one possible approach for finding an appropriate rank of
# close-to-singular data with a more conservative threshold.

# %%

# gets the singular values of the data across epochs
s = np.linalg.svd(data, compute_uv=False).min(axis=0)
# finds how many singular values are 'close' to the largest singular value
rank = np.count_nonzero(s >= s[0] * 1e-4)  # 1e-4 is the 'closeness' criteria, which is
# a hyper-parameter

###############################################################################
# Limitations
# -----------
#
# Multivariate methods offer many benefits in the form of dimensionality
# reduction and signal-to-noise ratio improvements. However, no method is
# perfect. When we simulated the data, we mentioned how we considered the seeds
# and targets to be signals of different modalities. This is an important
# factor in whether CaCoh should be used over methods based solely on the
# imaginary part of coherency such as MIC and MIM.
#
# In short, if you want to examine connectivity between signals from the same
# modality or from different modalities using a shared reference, you should
# consider using another method instead of CaCoh. Rather, methods based on the
# imaginary part of coherency such as MIC and MIM should be used to avoid
# spurious connectivity estimates stemming from e.g. volume conduction
# artefacts.
#
# On the other hand, if you want to examine connectivity between signals from
# different modalities using different references, CaCoh is a more appropriate
# method than MIC/MIM. This is because volume conduction artefacts are of less
# concern, and CaCoh does not risk biasing connectivity estimates towards
# interactions with particular phase lags like MIC/MIM.
#
# These scenarios are described in more detail in the
# :doc:`compare_coherency_methods` example.
