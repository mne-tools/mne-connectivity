        "## Background\n\nWith multivariate connectivity, interactions between multiple signals can be\nconsidered together, and the number of signals designated as seeds and\ntargets does not have to be equal within or across connections. Issues can\narise from this when storing information associated with connectivity in\narrays, as the number of entries within each dimension can vary within and\nacross connections depending on the number of seeds and targets. Such arrays\nare 'ragged', and support for ragged arrays is limited in NumPy to the\n``object`` datatype. Not only is working with ragged arrays is cumbersome,\nbut saving arrays with ``dtype='object'`` is not supported by the h5netcdf\nengine used to save connectivity objects. The workaround used in\nMNE-Connectivity is to pad ragged arrays with some known values according to\nthe largest number of entries in each dimension, such that there is an equal\namount of information across and within connections for each dimension of the\narrays.\n\nAs an example, consider we have 5 channels and want to compute 2 connections:\nthe first between channels in indices 0 and 1 with those in indices 2, 3,\nand 4; and the second between channels 0, 1, 2, and 3 with channel 4. The\nseed and target indices can be written as such::\n\n  seeds   = [[0, 1   ], [0, 1, 2, 3]]\n  targets = [[2, 3, 4], [4         ]]\n\nThe ``indices`` parameter passed to\n:func:`~mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity_epochs` and\n:func:`~mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity_time` must be a tuple of\narray-likes, meaning\nthat the indices can be passed as a tuple of: lists; tuples; or NumPy arrays.\nExamples of how ``indices`` can be formed are shown below::\n\n  # tuple of lists\n  ragged_indices = ([[0, 1   ], [0, 1, 2, 3]],\n                    [[2, 3, 4], [4         ]])\n\n  # tuple of tuples\n  ragged_indices = (((0, 1   ), (0, 1, 2, 3)),\n                    ((2, 3, 4), (4         )))\n\n  # tuple of arrays\n  ragged_indices = (np.array([[0, 1   ], [0, 1, 2, 3]], dtype='object'),\n                    np.array([[2, 3, 4], [4         ]], dtype='object'))\n\n**N.B. Note that since NumPy v1.19.0, dtype='object' must be specified when\nforming ragged arrays.**\n\nJust as for bivariate connectivity, the length of ``indices[0]`` and\n``indices[1]`` is equal (i.e. the number of connections), however information\nabout the multiple channel indices for each connection is stored in a nested\narray. Importantly, these indices are ragged, as the first connection will be\ncomputed between 2 seed and 3 target channels, and the second connection\nbetween 4 seed and 1 target channel(s). The connectivity functions will\nrecognise the indices as being ragged, and pad them to a 'full' array by\nadding placeholder values which are masked accordingly. This makes the\nindices easier to work with, and also compatible with the engine used to save\nconnectivity objects. For example, the above indices would become::\n\n  padded_indices = (np.array([[0, 1, --, --], [0,  1,  2,  3]]),\n                    np.array([[2, 3,  4, --], [4, --, --, --]]))\n\nwhere ``--`` are masked entries. These indices are what is stored in the\nreturned connectivity objects.\n\nFor the connectivity results themselves, the methods available in\nMNE-Connectivity combine information across the different channels into a\nsingle (time-)frequency-resolved connectivity spectrum, regardless of the\nnumber of seed and target channels, so ragged arrays are not a concern here.\nHowever, the maximised imaginary part of coherency (MIC) method also returns\nspatial patterns of connectivity, which show the contribution of each channel\nto the dimensionality-reduced connectivity estimate (explained in more detail\nin :doc:`mic_mim`). Because these patterns are returned for each channel,\ntheir shape can vary depending on the number of seeds and targets in each\nconnection, making them ragged. To avoid this, the patterns are padded along\nthe channel axis with the known and invalid entry ``np.nan``, in line with\nthat applied to ``indices``. Extracting only the valid spatial patterns from\nthe connectivity object is trivial, as shown below:\n\n"
