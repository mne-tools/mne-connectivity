MNE-Connectivity
================

`MNE-Connectivity`_ is an open-source Python package for connectivity and
related measures of MEG, EEG, or iEEG data built on top of the 
`MNE-Python`_ API. It includes modules for data input/output, visualization,
common connectivity analysis, and post-hoc statistics and processing.

This project was initially ported over from mne-python starting v0.23, by Adam
Li as part of Google Summer of Code 2021. Subsequently v0.1 and v0.2 releases
were done as part of GSoC period. Future development will occur in subsequent
versions.

A Note About Connectivity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the neuroscience community as of 2021, the term "functional connectivity" can 
have many different meanings and comprises many different measures. Some of 
these measures are directed (i.e. try to map a statistical causal relationship between
brain regions), others are non-directed. Please note that the interpretation of your 
functional connectivity measure depends on the data and underlying
assumptions. 
For a taxonomy of functional connectivity measures and information on the 
interpretation of those measures, we refer to
`Bastos and Schoffelen`_.

In mne-connectivity, we do not claim that any of our measures imply causal
connectivity.
