This test is here extended to multivariate ARMA models; the test statistic may be conveniently expressed as a function of the covariances between the residuals of the fitted model. A modified form of the statistic designed to have superior properties in small samples is derived, and the two forms of the statistic are compared via computer simulation.},

	abstract = {© 2017 IEEE. Electrocorticography (ECoG) and stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) are popular tools for studying neural mechanisms governing behavior and neural disorders, such as epilepsy. In particular, clinicians are interested in identifying brain regions that start seizures, i.e., the epileptogenic zone (EZ) from such invasive recordings. Currently, they visually inspect signals from each electrode to locate abnormal activity, and are not informed by predictive models that can characterize such recordings and potentially increase accuracy in localizing the EZ. In this paper, we test whether a simple linear time varying (LTV) model is sufficient to characterize both ECoG and SEEG activity. Specifically, we construct linear time invariant models in consecutive time windows before, during and after seizure events creating an LTV model from data collected in one ECoG and one SEEG patient. We find that these LTV models accurately reconstruct both ECoG and SEEG time series measured suggesting that these LTV models can be used for EZ localization.},
