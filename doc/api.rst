:py:mod:`mne_connectivity`:

.. automodule:: mne_connectivity
   :no-members:
   :no-inherited-members:

This is the application programming interface (API) reference
for classes (``CamelCase`` names) and functions
(``underscore_case`` names) of MNE-Connectivity, grouped thematically by analysis
stage. The data structure classes contain different types of connectivity data
and are described below.
