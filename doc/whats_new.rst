Changes when mne-connectivity was part of MNE-Python
----------------------------------------------------

In July, 2021, ``mne.connectivity`` submodule was ported over from the MNE-Python 
repo into this repository, ``mne-connectivity``. Starting v0.24 of MNE-Python, that sub-module 
will be deprecated and development will move over into this repository.
