Enhancements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Adding symmetric orthogonalization via :func:`mne_connectivity.symmetric_orth`, by `Eric Larson`_ (:gh:`36`)
- Improved RAM usage for :func:`mne_connectivity.vector_auto_regression` by leveraging code from ``statsmodels``, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`46`)
- Added :func:`mne_connectivity.select_order` for helping to select VAR order using information criterion, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`46`)
- All connectivity functions retain ``events``, ``event_id`` and ``metadata`` from `mne.Epochs` objects as input and is stored as part of the connectivity object, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`58`)
- Add spectral connectivity over time function :func:`mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity_time`, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`67`)
- Add directed phase lag index (dPLI) as a method in :func:`mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity_epochs` with a corresponding example by `Kenji Marshall`_ (:gh:`79`)
- Add conda installation, by `Adam Li`_ and `Richard HÃ¶chenberger`_ (:gh:`81`)

Bug
~~~

- Fixed bug when saving connectivity with ``n_jobs`` greater than 1 from :func:`mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity_epochs`, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`43`)
- Fixed bug to allow saving complex data connectivity, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`43`)
- Fixed bug to keep label orientation upright in :func:`mne_connectivity.viz.plot_connectivity_circle`, by `Alexander Kroner`_ (:gh:`60`)

API
~~~

- Added ``h5netcdf`` as a requirement for saving connectivity data, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`43`)
- Changed keyword argument ``model_order`` in :func:`mne_connectivity.vector_auto_regression` to ``lags`` to more align with statsmodels API, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`47`)
- Add ``pandas`` as a requirement for dealing with metadata associated from the original Epochs file, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`58`)
- Rename ``mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity`` to :func:`mne_connectivity.spectral_connectivity_epochs`, by `Adam Li`_ (:gh:`69`)
